# RMusicDL
A desktop application that allows you to save your favorite playlists online and download all the content they contain. You can even choose in which audio format you want your music and where to download it. In addition, the content of the playlists will be updated and existing content will not be re-downloaded.

## How it works

## Purpose
This app was designed to download playlists from Youtube. Nontheless, it can technically download a music only or content of channel on youtube and even from other web site as it uses yt-dlp to download the contents which support a lot of websites (list of all supported websites [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md)), but I don't know what will be the behavior with those.

## Issues
If you find any bugs or have any request about an enhancement for the software don't hesitate to add in the Issues tab and I will be glad to try to answer your request.

## Contribution
Any help is appreciated.
